# Tennis-Data-Analytics-Insights-with-SportRadar-Streamlit
Tennis is a data-rich sport, where player performance, match statistics, and tournament trends can reveal valuable insights. This project, Tennis Data Analytics & Insights with SportRadar & Streamlit, aims to harness real-time and historical tennis data to generate meaningful analytics using Python, SQL, and Streamlit.

By integrating the SportRadar API, this project automates the collection of structured tennis data, including match results, player rankings, head-to-head stats, and tournament details. The extracted data is stored in an SQL database, allowing for efficient querying and analysis. The insights derived from this data are presented through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, enabling users to explore match trends, player statistics, and performance analytics dynamically.

The project is designed for data analysts, sports enthusiasts, and tennis professionals who seek a data-driven approach to understanding the game. Whether it’s identifying patterns in player performances, comparing historical match statistics, or tracking tournament trends, this platform provides a comprehensive and user-friendly analytics solution.

By leveraging Python scripting, SQL-based data management, and Streamlit’s visualization capabilities, this project transforms raw tennis data into actionable insights, making it a valuable tool for tennis fans, analysts, and coaches
